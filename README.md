# IMDB-Sentiment-Analysis
This project aims to classify movie reviews from the IMDB dataset as either positive or negative using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to apply advanced machine learning and deep learning models to predict the sentiment of each review and compare them with the predictions of traditional machine learning models.
